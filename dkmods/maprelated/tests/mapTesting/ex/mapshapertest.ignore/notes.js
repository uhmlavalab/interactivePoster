the mapshaper-test.html file should be able to run a local file that works



problem is determining the activations to make it works


so far looks like html is good

to determine file effects:

	mapshaper-gui.js

	look for the receiveFiles
	quickView set to true makes the auto plot instead of prompt

	look for futher effects there
